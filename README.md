# Heritage Railway Website - Reflection

## What requirements did I achieve
- I managed to layout the webpage using <body>, <nav> and <footer> tags to outline a clear structure to the user. I further used CSS styling to provide a clear difference between different elements on the page.
- I utilized CSS absolute positioning to accurately place each call to action ontop of each section image, displaying a layout that is consistent and professional.
- I utilized CSS Flexbox to provide a responsive layout which responds to the size of the window. Flexbox was used extensively throughout the webpage, most notably with the navigation bar and footer's different elements.
- The images that are on the webpage are sourced with file paths that link to images that are stored locally with the web files, this means that we don't depend on other web servers which would otherwise host these images for us.
- I added a 'back to top' button to the footer which is actually an anchor tag in code, this is so I could tell the button to scroll back to the top of the page, which otherwise was not possible with a traditional HTML <btn> tag.
- I implemented smooth scrolling by setting the CSS scroll-behaviour parameter to 'smooth' for the <HTML> tag, this ensures that the user experience is less jarring when using the navigation bar to navigate to different sections.
- I implemented a hover effect to buttons so users can differentiate between interactive and non-interactive buttons on the page, most notably changing the colour of the buttons when the user hovers their mouse over.
- I created a footer which contains a copyright notice, 'back to top' button and a section which contains buttons to the railway's social media accounts - sort of, they really just visit each social media website rather than a specific account but we were not expected to make fake accounts.

## Were there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve?
- I did not include a background track to the website. I decided this because I could not decide on a suitable background track for a heritage railway, therefore I did not deem it suitable.

## Extra reflection
- When I got stuck with something, W3School and Stack Exchange was my main source of information for finding a solution. Reading W3School in particular helped me gain more experience with reading documentation for markup/coding languages and frameworks.
- If I could change something, I would have made the footer fixed to the page, this is because I noticed if a user exclusively used the navigation bar for moving around the page and they didn't scroll with the mouse, they might miss the footer and therefore miss the railway's social media presence. This of course might be rectified by including the social media presence in the railway's About page, however due to the scope of the assignment the problem is much bigger.
- Considering I didn't have a ton of experience with HTML and CSS prior to starting the bootcamp, I am quite pleased with how the webpage turned out. I am particularly excited to gain more experience and discover my own standard and style for how I design my web pages.
